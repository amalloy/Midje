The file 'tasks.clj' contains a Cake task that checks both
Midje facts and clojure.test tests.  Here's an example of
its use:

     6891 $ cake midje
     
     +++ The following shows how 'cake midje' checks facts in test files.
     +++ The failure is intentional.
     
     FAIL at (t_core.clj:13)
         Expected: "I am a test file fact"
           Actual: 3
     
     +++ The following shows how 'cake midje' checks facts in source files.
     +++ The failure is intentional.
     
     FAIL at (core.clj:7)
         Expected: "I am a source-file fact."
           Actual: 3
     
     +++ The following shows how 'cake midje' runs clojure.test deftests.
     +++ The failure is intentional.
     >>> Output from clojure.test tests:
     
     FAIL in (a-clojure-test-test) (t_core.clj:8)
     expected: (= 1 "I am a deftest expected result.")
       actual: (not (= 1 "I am a deftest expected result."))
     
     >>> clojure.test summary:
     Ran 1 tests containing 1 assertions.
     1 failures, 0 errors.
     >>> Midje summary:
     FAILURE: 2 facts were not confirmed. 
     6892 $ 


The task is run in the :test context.

If your project has no tasks.clj already, the easiest thing
to do is copy my version into your project hierarchy. If you
already have a tasks.clj, you can add my code to that file,
put my source in project.clj, or put a renamed copy of the
file in your 'src' directory. See the Cake documentation
